Write a function that generates the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, but with a twist:

If the Fibonacci number is divisible by 3, replace it with "Fizz".

If divisible by 5, replace it with "Buzz".

If divisible by both 3 and 5, replace it with "FizzBuzz".

Return the resulting list.
